## 1. Project Overview
**xLLM-service** is a service-layer framework developed based on the **xLLM** inference engine, providing efficient, fault-tolerant, and flexible LLM inference services for clustered deployment.

xLLM-service targets to address key challenges in enterprise-level service scenarios:

- How to ensure the SLA of online services and improve resource utilization of offline tasks in a hybrid online-offline deployment environment.

- How to react to changing request loads in actual businesses, such as fluctuations in input/output lengths.

- Resolving performance bottlenecks of multimodal model requests.

- Ensuring high reliability of computing instances.

---

## 2. Key Features
With management of computing resource pools, intelligent scheduling and preemption of hybrid requests, and real-time monitoring of computing instances, xLLM-service achieves the following key features:

- Unified scheduling of online and offline requests, with preemptive execution for online requests and best-effort execution for offline requests.

- Adaptive dynamic allocation of PD ratios, supporting efficient switching of instance PD roles.

- EPD three-stage disaggregation for multimodal requests, with intelligent resource allocation for different stages.

- Fault-tolerant architecture, fast detection of instance error and automatic rescheduling for interrupted requests.

## 4. Quick Start
#### Installation
```bash
git clone git@coding.jd.com:xllm-ai/xllm_service.git
cd xllm_service
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
#### Compilation
compile xllm-service: 
```bash
# prepare.sh checks libcpprest-dev, installs it only when running as root on Debian/Ubuntu,
# and then applies the cpprestsdk patch. Otherwise install libcpprest-dev manually first.
sh prepare.sh
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j 8
```
